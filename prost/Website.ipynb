    "The Protein Language Search Tool (**PROST**) is a highly accurate and efficient homology search tool designed for remote homology prediction tasks. In comparison to the current state-of-the-art tools, such as CS-BLAST or PHMMER, PROST outperforms them in terms of accuracy and speed. PROST utilizes a protein language model and quantization technique to represent proteins in a numerical format that retains their biophysical, biochemical, and evolutionary information. PROST calculates the distances of all proteins in the database to the user's query protein and performs a statistical test based on the Z-Score of the distance distribution over the entire database. The results are presented with an expected value (e-value) that estimates the likelihood of a match occurring by chance. This value is calculated from the CDF of the z-score and is corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic GO Enrichment Analysis\n",
    "The GO annotation enrichment pipeline in PROST allows for the selection of a different e-value cutoff. This threshold determines the level of significance for the enrichment analysis. To assess the significance of the enriched GO terms, contingency tables are constructed by comparing the frequency of individual GO terms in homologs and the Swissprot database. A term-specific p-value is then calculated by subjecting the contingency table to the Chi-square test. Subsequently, Bonferroni multiple p-test corrections are applied to correct the p-values for each term. Any GO term with a p-value greater than 0.001 is removed from the analysis. The remaining GO terms are evaluated based on their source proteins' e-values, which are combined using Stoufferâ€™s method. The resulting GO terms are subjected to another round of multiple test correction, and the enriched terms are reported..\n",
